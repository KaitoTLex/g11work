Slavery was widely present throughout colonies, many were africans. Africans were used as common laborers. Natives weren't used as slaves as they were wiped from disease and they knew the land so they can escape. Africans were less likely to run. Africans were transported throughout the triangular trade route (Middle Passage) and were in harsh treatment where 1/5th would die. South liked slave that harvest cash crops (Rice, Tobaccoo, Indigo) while the North Slaves were used in Transport and Domestic Servants. 
Slave population outgrew the whites 90% lived in rural areas, they did housekeeping and child redering and field.
