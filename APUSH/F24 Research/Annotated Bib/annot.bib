While white women were mostly disregarded in matters of contemporary politics, many of them attended political and social events whenever they could to increase the proportion of women in attendance. The controversial premise of this source explores the manner in which women have impacted Whig politics. This essay's author lists the goals that women met at this time that might have affected their eligibility to vote. White women were largely marginalized in relation to ongoing political issues, even though many of them attended political and social events whenever they could. Women's participation rates may rise as a result. The focus of this is to look at the government as well as women exploiting the vulnerability in the two-party system.}

               techniques to implement 3D windows in an IVE. Menus (windows) are classified
               into three categories based on their association with the IVE. (1) The \emph{world?fixed}
               menu is a set of menus that will always appear in the same exact position in the
               IVE. (2) \emph{Object-fixed} menus are those that are associate with only one single object
               in the world. (3) The last category is the \emph{view-fixed} menu which will always appear
               in the same position relative to the current user view. This menu classification
               provides a new perspective to the CHI problem in an IVE.}

  author    = {Kurt Thearling and Barry Becker and Dennis DeCosta},
  title     = {Visualizing Data Mining Models},
  booktitle = {Proc. Integration of Data Mining and Data Visualization Workshop},
  year      = {1998},
  annote    = {Kurt Thearling et al. provide an excellent review of the most recent work in
               the arena of data visualization. Although the work is not intended
               for IVE applications, most of the ideas were instrumental in understanding some
               of the inherent difficulties in data visualization. For example, from this
               work it became evident to us that \emph{orienteering} is one of the most important
               aspects in an IVE. This indicates that it is important to examine possible solutions
               to properly orient the user early in the project. Some of the ideas presented
               includes maintaining a grid that defines the three axes $(x, y, z)$ and the notion
               of a companion menu that, when invoked, aids the user in locating and transporting
               themselves within the environment. The authors also emphasize the importance of
               ``trusting the model.'' Trust here refers to the user's ability to comfortably
               rely on the methods provided to correctly interpret the visual
               presentation at hand.}
